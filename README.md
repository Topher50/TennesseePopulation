# TennesseePopulation
Visualization of Tennessee population stats

Uses topojson file generated from shape files on Tennessee and information from the census. Default boundries are from the county lines and census tract boundries can be added or removed using the tract boundries button. The color can be changed to blue to bring out the differences in population even more using the color button.

For some reason d3 is really slow at drawing the map so be patient and give it some time.
